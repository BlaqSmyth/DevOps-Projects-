# Deploying a LAMP STACK Web Application on AWS Cloud 
____
A LAMP stack is a bundle of four different software technologies that developers use to build websites and web applications. LAMP is an acronym for the operating system, Linux; the web server, Apache; the database server, MySQL; and the programming language, PHP. All four of these technologies are open source, which means they are community maintained and freely available for anyone to use. Developers use LAMP stacks to create, host, and maintain web content. It is a popular solution that powers many of the websites you commonly use today.
## Step 0 Creating Virtual Machine(EC2 Instance)
In order to complete this project you will need an AWS account and a virtual server with Ubuntu Server OS. AWS is the biggest Cloud Service Provider and it offers a free tier account that we are going to leverage for our projects.

You can watch the two videos below to set-up and connect to your EC2 instance on AWS;
